# node-ddd-template
Node template for building apps using DDD

Heavily inspired by
* https://github.com/talyssonoc/node-api-boilerplate (which inspired this: https://github.com/asyrafduyshart/node-clean-architecture)
* https://github.com/joshuaalpuerto/node-ddd-boilerplate

Docs and wiki stand, with a few modifications. This version contains implementation for domain events.
